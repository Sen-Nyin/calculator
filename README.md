# Calculator

This calculator application was built for the final project of The Odin Project on Day 16 of my 100 days of code, in my path to become a developer. In total, this took approximately 4 hours of work + an hour or so of non-functional tweaks to code structure and visuals.

# Introduction

The calculator allows continuous execution of operations. Entering 5 + 6 \* 12 - 4 / 3 + 7 etc., will continue to work until you give up or hit equals.

Additionally, pressing, for example, 2 then + then = and then repeatedly pressing = will result in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 etc.,. This functionality works with all operators.

Your previous entry or the current running total is displayed in the top-left corner of the display pane.

The solar panel is just for show and does not actually convert light energy!

# Technologies

- HTML (I should hope so!)
- Sass (Scss)
- Javascript

# Learnings

## Mental

Mentally I learned that believing in myself is important. Before I started I didn't believe that I had the JS knowledge to finish the job. It turned out that I did!

## Start from scratch

If I need to, I should not be afraid to delete what I've done so far and start again. At approximately 2.5 hours into my code I had everything working apart from the continuous operation. I had been staring at the same code for over an hour wondering why it wasn't working. The answer was to delete it (as well as the next point) and start over.

## Step away

Staring at the code wasn't helping me think. Stepping away from the screen, taking a breath, topping up my coffee and then coming back was a life saver.

This step, along with the above step, had me finish all functionality within the next hour.

## Resources used

I'm proud of myself to say that I didn't use external resources to help figure this one out. The only time I used Google was to get the HTML codes for the symbols on the buttons.

## Shoutouts

Big shout outs to the twitter tech community for being so encouraging of new, self-learning developers. Particularly [LifeLongThinker](https://www.twitter.com/LifeLongThinker)
